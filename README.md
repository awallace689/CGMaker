# CardGame
A Python Project

The RuleABC branch of CardGame contains the same (although versioning may differ) Card and DeckWrapper implementation as master, although it will use a Rules abstract base class to define behavior of any rules set. The first rules set to be implemented will be the Blackjack rules set, a subclass of RuleABC. The RuleABC subclass will interact with GameManager (to be implemented) to run a game of blackjack in the console.
